\chapter{Discussion}

The evaluation and comparison of \textit{SpaM-Align} against \textit{Dialign} and \textit{Mafft} on the \bb dataset revealed that the produced alignments are slightly inferior to Dialign in the best case, using a pattern with two \textit{Match} and eleven \textit{Don't Care} positons on the RV20 reference set, and significantly worse than \textit{Mafft} in every case. 

%This should contain the discussion of the evaluation, not be confused with the conclusion https://www.enago.com/academy/discussion-conclusion-know-difference-drafting-manuscript/

%\begin{itemize}
%	\item execution times include finding of micro alignments which is unnecessarily complex atm. and takes up roughly 50\% of program run time 
%\end{itemize}

% Maybe this?
%Quality measures for protein alignment benchmarks \\
