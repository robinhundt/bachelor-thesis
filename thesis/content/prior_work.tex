\chapter{Prior Work}
Spam-Align align builds upon several other algorithms and methods, namely GABIOS-LIB by Abdedda{\"\i}m \cite{abdeddaim1997incremental}, Dialign by Morgenstern et al. \cite{morgenstern1996multiple} which later incorporated GABIOS-LIB \cite{abdeddaim2000speeding} as well as Spaced Word Matches proposed by Leimeister et al. in \textit{Fast alignment-free sequence comparison using spaced-word frequencies} \cite{leimeister2014fast}.

\section{GABIOS-LIB}

GABIOS-LIB is a library written by Sa{\"\i}d Abdedda{\"\i}m implementing the \textit{EdgeAddition} algorithm for the incremental computation of the transitive closure of an alignment graph \cite{abdeddaim1997incremental}. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item written to be used in greedy alignment algorithms, used in Dialign 2.2
	\item able to answer the question of whether two sites are alignable in $o(1)$
	\item allows efficient incremental updates of closure when new sites are added to alignment 
	\item $O(k^2n+n^2)$ time for k sequences with a total length of n ($n = |X|$)
	\item $O(kn)$ space
\end{itemize}
 

\section{Dialign}
Dialign is a multiple sequence algorithm first proposed by Morgenstern et al. in 1996 \cite{morgenstern1996multiple} with several alterations and reimplementations over the years  \cite{abdeddaim2000speeding, morgenstern1999dialign, sub:wey:kau:mor:05, sub:kau:mor:08, morgenstern2004dialign}. In the following, \textit{Dialign} will refer to the version 2.2 \cite{morgenstern2004dialign} of the software.\\


\begin{itemize}
	\item is an iterative and greedy algorithm
	\item first computes pairwise alignments  consisting of a set of non overlapping segment pairs (referred to as diagonals) with a maximal sum of scores for every combination of sequences
	\item set of diagonals is scored by their weight and greedily incorporated into alignment while using GABIOS-LIB to efficiently ensure consistent of alignments
	\item diagonals with score below threshold (default 0) are discarded
	\item process of finding diagonals and adding them to alignment is repeated for unaligned parts of sequences until everything is aligned or no diagonals of positive score can be found
	\item dialign sepnds majority of time on constructing paiwise alignments in order to find diagonals -> src is own lousy profile, maybe show profile data for big alignment in bb in appendix?
\end{itemize}



\section{Spaced Word Matches}

\begin{itemize}
	\item based on spaced seeds by \cite{ma2002patternhunter}
	\item pattern of care and don't care positions is used to find imprecise? matches between sequences 
\end{itemize}

\begin{mydef}[Pattern as defined in \cite{hundt2020praktkium}]
	A Pattern is a sequence over the Alphabet $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$, where $1$ corresponds to a "Match position" and $0$ to a "Don't Care" position. A patterns weight $k$ is defined as the number of "Match positions" it contains.
\end{mydef}
