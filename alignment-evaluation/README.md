# Alignment Evaluation

This folder contains the evaluation of the spam-align alignment algorithm.  

Note that the code contained herein is of lower quality than the one contained in the `spam-align` and `bali-score` repositories since it is not intended for reuse. 

## Dependencies
For the rust program located under `src/main.rs` the following dependencies need to be available:
- The current stable Rust toolchain must be installed in order to compile the program, refer to https://rustup.rs if not already installed
- Mafft version 7 must be installed and available in the `PATH`
- the patched Dialign2.2 version located at `../dialign_pacakge` must be available and compiled with the provided Makefile
  
Further processing of the data generated by the Rust program is done by `Evalution.ipynb` Jupyter notebook. Refer to the first cell for the used dependencies (numpy, matplotlib, etc.).

## Running the Rust program

In order to run the Rust program which evaluates `spam-align` for the pattern sets located under `../patter_set/` simply run
```
cargo run --release
```

the output will be placed under `../evaluation-data/`.
